# Cybarchive

Cybarchive is a CLI application to easily archive whole folders to a tar.gz format and upload it to a given S3 bucket.

While I made this tool to help achieve a 3-2-1/3-2-2 backup strategy, it is not foolproof and I cannot be held responsible for data loss. This tool is provided without any kind of warranty whatsoever.

## Features

- GnuPG file encryption/signature support
- S3 buckets support
- Webhook support
- Configurable
- Designed for cron jobs
